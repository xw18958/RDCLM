# Enhancing Zero-Shot Learning of Pathology Vision-Language Foundation Models in Tumour Malignancy Recognition
Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs) demonstrate promise in zero-shot learning through joint visual-textual representations. However, in histopathology image analysis, their effectiveness is limited by weak image-text alignment due to coarsegrained textual descriptions that fail to capture critical fine-grained visual details. This misalignment introduces semantic noise and imprecision in zero-shot retrieval, hindering the identification of relevant cases and degrading downstream classification. To address this, we introduce Retrieval-based De-noising Causal Language Modelling (RDCLM), a novel framework that refines noisy retrieval outputs from pathology VLFMs. RDCLM constructs a pathologyspecific knowledge base of fine-grained, discriminative tumour malignancy descriptions using a large language model (LLM). Given a query histopathology image, a pathology VLFM retrieves candidate descriptions from this knowledge base. Our de-noising module, leveraging a frozen language model, integrates visual features with these retrieved texts, filtering irrelevant content and enhancing semantic alignment. This significantly improves retrieval precision (by an average of 10% across datasets) and enables more accurate zeroshot image classification. To further bolster performance and generalization, we propose two retrieval augmentation strategies: Retrieval Negatives Replacement (RNR) and Description-wise Shuffling (DS). Extensive evaluations across four histopathology cancer datasets demonstrate that RDCLM significantly outperforms stateof-the-art methods in both zero-shot image-text retrieval and malignancy classification, achieving an average improvement of 12.7% in F1-score and 9.6% in accuracy over the second-best competitor. These results highlight the importance of retrieval de-noising for advancing VLFM-based zero-shot learning in histopathology.
